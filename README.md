A project to build a stock data pipeline and ML recommendation system.

I am using the project to learn about building data pipelines, data analysis using ELK stack, and building ML models for identifying stocks to consider for buy or sell based on some basic dividend value based investment formulas.  
In this project I will keep my notes on building my data collector, any files needed to enable transformation and ingestion into an ELK system and/or DB to enable analysis, ML code for models I play with, and really anything else to enable a full stack datascience system for basic stock analysis.
